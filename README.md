# 100 Days CSS Challenge

I'm taking on the **100 Days CSS Challenge** from [100DaysCSS.com](https://100dayscss.com) to improve my CSS skills!

## What is 100 Days CSS?

The challenge involves completing 100 unique CSS design tasks over 100 days. Each day presents a new challenge to help practice and master CSS.

## How to Follow Along

Each dayâ€™s challenge will be stored in its own folder (e.g., `challenge-001`, `challenge-002`, etc.), with the necessary HTML and CSS files.

Feel free to clone this repository and try the challenges yourself!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlessa/100-days-css-challenge.git
